- The title of the challenge is GET aHEAD, the fact that HEAD is bolded could mean that it has something to do with the different [[HTTP request methods]]
- Going into [[BurpSuite]], I opened up the proxy and went to the challenge website
- after making a couple request, I opened the logger tab to see my requests, and then right clicked on one of the GET requests and sent it over to Repeater
- I changed the GET request to a HEAD request and sent it, and it returned the flag!!!
