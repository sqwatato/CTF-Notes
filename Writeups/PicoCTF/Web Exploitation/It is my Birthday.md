I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.Â [http://mercury.picoctf.net:20277/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:20277/)

- on the page u can submit 2 pdfs and based on the text they need to have a hash collision without being the same pdf
- i searched up md5 pdf collision https://github.com/corkami/collisions/blob/master/examples/free/md5-2.pdf
