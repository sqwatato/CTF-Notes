CTFS (SHORT FOR CAPTURE THE FLAG) ARE A TYPE OF COMPUTER SECURITY COMPETITION. CONTESTANTS ARE PRESENTED WITH A SET OF CHALLENGES WHICH TEST THEIR CREATIVITY, TECHNICAL (AND GOOGLING) SKILLS, AND PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITY. CHALLENGES USUALLY COVER A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES, AND WHEN SOLVED, EACH YIELDS A STRING (CALLED A FLAG) WHICH IS SUBMITTED TO AN ONLINE SCORING SERVICE. CTFS ARE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN A WIDE ARRAY OF COMPUTER SECURITY SKILLS IN A SAFE, LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, AND ARE HOSTED AND PLAYED BY MANY SECURITY GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD FOR FUN AND PRACTICE. FOR THIS PROBLEM, THE FLAG IS: PICOCTF{FR3XU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_7AA384BC}
