- example: `I LOVE PITTSBURGH` (from picoCTF primer lol)
- remove spaces from plaintext
	- `ILOVEPITTSBURGH`
- with key `PICOCTF`, repeating the characters if needed to fit length, we end up with the key `PICOCTFPICOCTFP`
- with a as 0 and z as 25, you can add the plaintext characters with the key characters and mode 26 and convert back to characters to get the encrypted message
