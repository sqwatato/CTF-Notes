- identifies security properties
- **Common Security Properties**:
    
    - **RELRO**: Read-only relocation (RELRO) helps protect against certain types of attacks by making parts of the binaryâ€™s memory read-only after dynamic linking.
    - **STACK CANARY**: A stack canary is a value placed on the stack to detect buffer overflows.
    - **NX (No-Execute)**: NX prevents execution of code from writable memory regions, reducing the risk of buffer overflow attacks.
    - **PIE (Position-Independent Executable)**: PIE randomizes the base address of the binary, making it harder for attackers to predict memory locations.
    - **RPATH/RUNPATH**: These properties control the search paths for shared libraries.
    - **Symbols**: Indicates whether symbols (debugging information) are present in the binary.
    - **FORTIFY**: Fortification adds runtime checks to prevent buffer overflows.

    To disable this functionality, set the contents of /home/jayden/.cache/.pwntools-cache-3.11/update to 'never' (old way).
    Or add the following lines to ~/.pwn.conf or ~/.config/pwn.conf (or /etc/pwn.conf system-wide):
        [update]
        interval=never
