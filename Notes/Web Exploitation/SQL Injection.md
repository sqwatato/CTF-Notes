- put some [[SQL]] through user inputs to milk out that juicy info!!!
- used for [[Blind SQL Injection]]

##### OR Injection
- if website is doing some silly stuff and is not validating stuff, instead of entering a proper username or password, you can enter some sql
- pretend this command is run by database (\<var> is replaced by the user input)
	- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<user>' AND password = '<pass>'`
- if we enter `'OR 1=1 --`, anything OR true will **always** be true, so it will return every row in the table
- the `'` ends the string meant for the username and the `--` makes the rest of the command a comment
