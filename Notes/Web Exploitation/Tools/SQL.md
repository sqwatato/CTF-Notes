- `AVG`: Calculate the average of values in a column.
- `MAX`: Find the highest value in a column.
- `MIN`: Find the lowest value in a column.

**Working with Multiple Tables:**

- `JOIN`: Combine data from multiple tables based on relationships.
- `INNER JOIN`: Include rows where the join condition matches in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN`: Include all rows from the left table, even if no match is found in the right table.
- `RIGHT JOIN`: Include all rows from the right table, even if no match is found in the left table.

**Data Manipulation:**

- `INSERT`: Add new rows to a table.
- `UPDATE`: Change existing data in a table.
- `DELETE`: Remove rows from a table.

**Other Useful Clauses:**

- `DISTINCT`: Remove duplicate rows from the result.
- `HAVING`: Filter grouped data based on aggregate functions.
- `GROUP BY`: Group data by one or more columns.
- `AS`: Create aliases for columns or tables.

**Data Selection:**

- **Retrieve all columns from the "customers" table:**
	- `SELECT * FROM customers;`

- **Retrieve only the "name" and "email" columns from the "customers" table:**
	- `SELECT name, email FROM customers;`

- **Retrieve customers with a salary greater than 50,000:**
	- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;`

- **Retrieve products with a price over 100 in the "Electronics" category:**
	- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 AND category = 'Electronics';`

- **Retrieve orders that are either "Shipped" or "Delivered":**
	- `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'Shipped' OR status = 'Delivered';`

- **Sort products by price in descending order:**
	- `SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;`

- **Retrieve the first 10 customers:**
	- `SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;`

**Data Manipulation:**

- **Insert a new customer:**
	- `INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');`

- **Update salaries for employees in the "Sales" department:**
	- `UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department = 'Sales';`

- **Delete discontinued products:**
	- `DELETE FROM products WHERE discontinued = 1;`

**Data Definition:**

- **Create a new "products" table:**
	- `CREATE TABLE products (product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price REAL);`

- **Drop the "customers" table:**
	- `DROP TABLE customers;`

- **Add a "hire_date" column to the "employees" table:**
	- `ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN hire_date DATE;`

**Joining Tables:**

- **Retrieve customer names and order dates by joining the "customers" and "orders" tables:**
	- `SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;`

**Aggregation:**

- **Count the total number of products:**
	- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;`

- **Calculate the total order value:**
	- `SELECT SUM(price) FROM orders;`

- **Find the average salary:**
	- `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;`

- **Retrieve the most recent order date:**
	- `SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders;`

- **Find the lowest product price:**
	- `SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;`
